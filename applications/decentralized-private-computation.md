## Project Overview ðŸ“„

This Project based in [ZEXE](https://github.com/AleoHQ/zexe/tree/master) and [ZEXE paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/962).
In order to  implement ideal_ledger,plain_dpc,delegable_dpc Pallet.

### Overview

This project will implement ideal_ledger,plain_dpc,delegable_dpc pallet (The following content is taken from  ZEXE paper):

1. ideal_ledger pallet
   In ZEXE's prototype.It is simply an ideal ledger, an append-only log of valid transactions that is stored in memory.
   It maintain a Merkle tree.
2. plain_dpc  pallet
   It is decentralized private computation (DPC) schemes, a cryptographic primitive in which parties with access to an ideal append-only ledger execute computations offline and subsequently post privacy-preserving, publicly-verifiable transactions that attest to the correctness of these offline executions.
3. delegable_dpc  pallet
   It is a DPC scheme in which a user can delegate to an untrusted worker the expensive computations associated with producing a transaction. The security goal is that the worker should not be able to produce valid transactions that have not been authorized by the user.
4. dpc_cli
   It is offline proof computation cli tool.It implements `execute` function part of plain_dpc and delegable_dpc.

### Project Details
the integration into Polkadot/Substrate:
phase 1 prototype stage:
- The merkle tree of transactions and commitments will store on the storage of substrate pallet ideal_ledger.
- plain_dpc transaction proof verify will implement in on-chain function verify  in substate pallet plain_dpc pallet.
- delegable_dpc transaction proof verify will implement in on-chain function verify  in substate pallet delegable_dpc pallet.

phase 2 privacy preserving applications:
support polkadot address.
private user-defined asset substrate pallet.
private DEX substrate pallet.
private stable coin substrate pallet.

phase 3 :
The another version of the offline proof computation execute part of plain_dpc and delegable_dpc .

Roadmap:
- 2024 Q2 (phase 1) : DPC prototype substate local development node.It includes ideal_ledger ,plain_dpc,delegable_dpc pallets.
- 2025 Q2 (phase 2) : DPC privacy-preserving application parachain/chain testnet.
It includes private user-defined asset ,private DEXs,private stable coins pallets.
- Future (phase 3) : DPC general-purpose privacy-preserving smart contract application parachain/chain.
It include private smart contract application examples.

### Ecosystem Fit

The target audience:
- privacy blockchain developers/operators/maintainer
- privacy preserving applications developers
- privacy preserving applications users

It meets data privacy and function privacy needs.

The examples of ZEXE such as zerocash,tornado cash [exmaples](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/veri-zexe/tree/main/src/examples)

There are similar projects in related ecosystems:
- [Aleo SnarkVM](https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkVM/tree/testnet2) ZEXE implement
- [Veri ZEXE](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/veri-zexe) ZEXE implement and improvement
